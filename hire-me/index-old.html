			<h4>Aurora Design Process Mini Case Study</h4>

			<p>Aurora is a video production company that Godfrey Advertising partners with on larger video projects. They were in the process of building a new, high-end soundstage and wanted a new web presence to match.</p>

			<p>The client needed help figuring out how to organize their site's content. I was able to get enough info from a few emails back and forth to create a <a href="http://eric.godfrey.com/aurora/Aurora-Content-Wireframes-D11b.pdf" title="Aurora wireframes" target="_blank">wireframe</a> that outlined the type of content that would appear in each section of each page. This document was played an important part during the client's writing process and was constantly being referred to in emails and phone calls.</p>

			<p>Since Aurora did not (and would not) provide any information about what they wanted the new look and feel to be, I set up a meeting to have a <a href="http://eric.godfrey.com/aurora/gut-check/" title="Aurora gut check" target="_blank">design gut check</a>. Within about 45 minutes of talking through why they did and did not like certain sites, I had a lot of valuable and insightful comments from the client that I would never have received by simply asking what they wanted.</p>

			<p>Using their feedback from the gut check to guide the design, and the wireframes to decide what types of elements to design, I created an <a href="http://eric.godfrey.com/aurora/element-collage/" title="Aurora element collage" target="_blank">element collage</a>. Presenting an element collage kept the feedback focused on the feel of the design instead of layout or content. Aurora responded well to the design and had a lot of positive comments that reaffirmed their earlier feedback during the gut check. I got the go-ahead for development without revisions.</p>

			<h4>Cool things I learned:</h4>

			<ul>
				<li>A design gut check can be <em>extremely</em> helpful when you find yourself without any direction whatsoever</li>
				<li>I picked up on how to write for/for each loops when the PHP developer was held up with other work for a few hours</li>
				<li>I built a custom WordPress theme and some back-end templates to go along with it</li>
			</ul>

		<p>While I can't say this is the best work I've done, I can say that I put more thought and effort into this site than any other. JLG is a fast-paced client and the site never stops growing. Working on the site from the ground up was a humbling learning experience.</p>
		<p>The landing pages were originally designed for use at tradeshows but were later adapted for use the web. I worked with a software developer to create the modular content blocks and the CMS-editable 360&deg; tours.</p>

		<p>McNeilus liked the JLG landing pages so much that they wanted one for themselves! I wrote and tested almost all of the functionality on this page before a software developer optimized my javascript beyond recognition. There's so much to learn!</p>
